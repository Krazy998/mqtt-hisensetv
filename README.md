# mqtt-hisensetv
Details on how to connect to Hisense Smart TV via the built in MQTT broker service.

Hisense Smart TV's (tested on 75P7 model) run a MQTT service on TCP port 36669 which is running mosquitto 1.4.2. This is primarily used to interact with the official hisense remote app.

## NOTE that later versions of Hisense TV's are using a encrpyted MQTT connection on the same port. You need to ensure to set encryption=on and validate=off in your client (as they are using a self signed cert.)

##NOTE some newer versions of Hisense TV's have additional checks around authentication codes.

You can send the authentication code by sending the following:
A user would need to publish
/remoteapp/tv/ui_service/HomeAssistant/actions/authenticationcode
{"authNum": XXXX}
where XXXX is the 4 digit number displayed on the screen. Once this pairing has been completed, the user than then send the other commands to change channel, power off etc.

To access this service connect via your MQTT client

with the following settings
```
Host: IP Address of your TV
Port: 36669
Username: hisenseservice
Password: multimqttservice


```

It needs the -m message paramater filled otherwise you get an error "Error: Both topic and message must be supplied"

# Change source. The 'sourceid' is all thats required to change to a new source. For example to change to HDMI1:
mosquitto_pub.exe -h <TV_IP> -p 36669 -P multimqttservice -u hisenseservice -t /remoteapp/tv/ui_service/AutoHTPC/actions/changesource -m {"sourceid":"3"}

The '' are needed to escape the quotes when run from the command line.

You can use 'sourcename' as well but its not necessary.
If you are then do not put a space in 'HDMI 1' eg: Use "sourcename":"HDMI1". I found using a space, which is what is shown when using 'sourcelist' above, gives an error.
